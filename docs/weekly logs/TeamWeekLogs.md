### Testing reports

The Jest testing framework was used. There was testing conducted on ensuring suitable ouputs for user error validation whilst interacting with the login and register pages.

Screenshot of some testing (testing code + file needing corrections so changes still required to have passed tests)

This is where the testing is at currently but it is being worked through on issue assigned on Kanban board.
